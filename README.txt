Simple scheme

Scheme is known as maxwell of computer science.
I always want to understand how it works.
So, I write an interpreter for its simple version.

Following special operators are supported:
define, lambda, if, cond, let, quote, assign.

It also supports big number and tail recursion.

Most SICP exercise can be written with it.
See example directory
