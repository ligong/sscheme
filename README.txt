Simple scheme

Scheme is known as maxwell of computer science.
I always want to understand how it works.
Finally, I find some time and write a simple scheme interpreter with C++.

This interpreter supports special operator:
define, lambda, if, cond, let, quote, assign.

It also supports big number and tail recursion.

Most SICP exercise can be written with it.
See the example directory in source files.
