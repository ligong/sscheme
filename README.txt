Simple Scheme

Scheme is known as "Maxwell's Equations of Software"
I always want to understand how it works.
With the belief that the best way of understanding is writing,
I use C++ to write an interpreter for a simplified Scheme version.

Currently, following special operators are supported:

if,cond,define,lambda,set!,set-car!,set-cdr!,cons,cdr,car,
list,eq?,string?,string=?,number?,atom?,pair?,not,and,or,
+,-,*,/,<,<=,>,>=,display,newline

A stop and copy garbage collector is implemented.

It is really fun to write an interpreter for the great language.
